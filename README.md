# SpringReact

The project is a translation (approximative) of tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST (https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/) to Kotlin language. 

Here there are only source files (src folders), IDE files must be downloaded separately.

For backend (server side) --- https://start.spring.io/ Gradle, Kotlin and dependencies from tutorial (except Lombok).

For frontend (browser) --- https://github.com/JetBrains/create-react-kotlin-app.
